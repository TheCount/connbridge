Application for creating a connection bridge.

It starts a TCP server on the source node, bridging all traffic between source
and specified destination. The bridged traffic is logged into files on a
per-socket basis.

This application may be useful for debugging high-volume traffic on
OSI layer 4. There are alternatives which might work better for you: there is
tcpdump (operates on OSI layer 2, may require root permissions and may
experience the occasional dropped packet). Furthermore, depending on your
application, there may be traffic loggers operating on higher OSI layers
(proxies, plugins).

This application depends on libev.
